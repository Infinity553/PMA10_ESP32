# PMA10_ESP32
A bit of Arduino code to connect the Analog 0-1V output of an M&amp;C PMA 10/15 to one of the Analog Inputs of an ESP32. 

I used an ESP32-S3 Zero from Waveshare cause it's tiny. 
I also added an BME280 Sensor for ambient measurements.

The WebUI can be used to connect to a Wifi Network and setup the MQTT Broker.
